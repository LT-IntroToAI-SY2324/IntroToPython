# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the "Learn Python with generative AI" portion of the write up and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.

### Learn Python with generative AI
The idea of this portion is that you will be coming up with your own practice questions that are tailored to your level of programming experience.  

Go to ChatGPT, or any other generative AI and type in a prompt like this:

```
I've just completed an entry-level programming course and want to put my 
Python coding skills to practice. 
Can you give me some programming challenge questions at a 
beginner-intermediate level?
```

Here is ChatGPT's response, yours could be different:
```
Of course! Here are some programming challenge questions that are suitable for someone with entry-level programming skills in Python:

**1. Hello, World!**

**3. Factorial Calculator**
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using loops or recursion.

**4. Guess the Number**
Create a simple number guessing game where the program generates a random number and the user tries to guess it. Provide hints such as "higher" or "lower" to help the user guess correctly.

**5. Fibonacci Sequence**
Write a program that generates the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

**6. Palindrome Checker**
Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

**7. Prime Number Checker**
Write a program that checks whether a given number is prime or not.

**8. Temperature Converter**
Write a program that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

**9. Rock, Paper, Scissors**
